# Todo App

The combination of React and Firebase can move web applications to complete next level. In this workshop, we are going to create an awesome full stack Todo app using React for front-end and Firebase realtime database as back-end. By the end of this workshop, you will learn about implementing CRUD operations using React. 

Take a peek at the final project. :point_down:

Check out [Live Demo](https://Todo-App-Final.giridharhackclu.repl.co) and [Source Code](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/Todo-App-Final#src/App.js). 

## Prerequisites

- You should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- You should know some fundamentals of React and React Hooks. 
- It's also a benefit to have a little bit of knowledge about Firebase. I recommend to complete [this]() workshop for knowledge about Firebase Realtime Database.

## Setup

### Coding Environment

We will be using [Repl.it](https://repl.it) for building our project. [Repl.it](https://repl.it) is an online code editor where you can code in different languages without any installations.

Fork this starter repl [here](https://repl.it/@Giridharhackclu/todo-app-starter#src/App.js). It contains `create-react-app` and `firebase` installed. It also contains all the styles required so that we can concentrate on React and Firebase.

After forking press the `Run` button on the top. If you an output something like this, you are good to go.

### Creating a Firebase Project

Now create a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account. You can access with your Google account

> **Firebase**: Google's Firebase is Backend-as-a-Service(BaaS), which makes us easy to add backend to our applications with some knowledge of server-side coding.

We are going to use Firebase Realtime Database as a database for out Todo App. 

> The Firebase Realtime Database is cloud-hosted. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. We can store and sync data across all clients in realtime and remains available when your app goes offline.
