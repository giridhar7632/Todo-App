# Todo App

The combination of React and Firebase can move web applications to complete next level. In this workshop, we are going to create an awesome full stack Todo app using React for front-end and Firebase realtime database as back-end. By the end of this workshop, you will learn about implementing CRUD operations using React. 

Take a peek at the final project. :point_down:

Check out [Live Demo]() and [Source Code]().

## Getting Started

React mainly gives us a structured way to create reusable frontend UI components, handle user input, update UI components efficiently, and manage your data. 

### Prerequisites

- You should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- You should know some fundamentals of React.
- It's also a benefit to have a little bit of knowledge about Firebase. I recommend to complete [this]() workshop for knowledge about Firebase Realtime Database.

### Setup

We will be using Repl.it for building our project. Repl.it is an online code editor where you can code in different languages without any installations.

Fork this starter repl [here](). It contains `create-react-app` and `firebase` installed. It also contains all the styles required, so we can concentrate on React and Firebase.
